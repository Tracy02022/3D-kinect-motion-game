# 3D-kinect-motion-game
Research project to make a motion sensing game, Use point cloud library and Kinect skeleton techniques.My work is to implement Body Gesture Capturing and 3D Avatar Rendering
Unfortunately, I didn't complete all the work here. I just make the skeleton move based on the person standing before the webcam.
Therefore, his or her skin and muscle cannot be moved together.

However, the whole body skeleton can move smoothly and real-time.
